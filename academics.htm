                <h2>AP Calculus AB</h2>
                <p>Ap Calculus AB is a college level math class offered at my home school. In order to recieve college credit, I must score a 4 or a 5 on the AP test, held in the first weeks of May. Thanks to my amazing teacher, Mr. Demsey, this class has been quite enjoyable.</p>

                <h2>AP Physics 1</h2>
                <p>Ap Physics 1... Where to start? During regristration for my Junior year, AP Physics 1 stood out to me. Sadly, it did not fit into my schedule, therefore I decided to challenge the AP test indepently. This means that I taught myself in preperation for the AP test, as opposed to taking the class.</p>
