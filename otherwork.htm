            <p>This was one of my favorite assignments personally, the goal was to generate a personalized ceritificate of the user's choosing. For mine, I decided to give the user three options for what certificate they wanted, HTML, CSS, and JS. What made this assignment so fun was the extra touch that I added to it. When the user filled out the required information, the certificate would be "typed" out, generating it in front of the user's eyes.</p>

                <p>CSS Zen Garden was one of the first web assignments given in the first semester. Therefore it is one that I am least proud of, but it also serves as a great reminder of how far I have come since then. The objective of this assignment was to design a website, with a prewritten HTML file that you were unable to edit. The only file I was able to edit was the CSS file. The reason I am not very proud of this assignment was due to the very interesting design that I decided upon.</p>
