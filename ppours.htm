            <p>In the Web Application Development lab at the Center for Advanced Research and Technology (CART), teams were tasked with creating a website for a business within Jurassic Park, such as a local bakery or a merchandise store. To prepare for the project, in their English class, students read Michael Crichtonâ€™s 1990 novel, Jurassic Park and focused on the character, Ian Malcolm, who argues that science shows Jurassic Park as a business will fail due to the playout of chaos theory. Furthermore, learning life lessons through the chaos in Jurassic Park are explored as well as a discussion of how these lessons can be applied to one's everyday life.  These lessons include controlling what you can, as chaos theory represents unpredictability of complex systems, life falls under this category. This has many implications in our day to day life that can change how we perceive our everyday life as well as the choices we make and what we decide to do with our time.</p>

                <p>Fall 2023 Showcase was the Web Application Develpment Lab's oppurtunity to showoff our Fall final project. Me and my partner created Prehistoric Pours! Our take on a local coffee shop set up on the island of Jurassic Park. We designed and compiled a website which included a fake online oerding service. This is easly the project that I have been most proud of throughout the year, from the interesting premise, to the wonderful outcome, this project was a success.</p>
