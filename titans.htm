            <p>Our board game, Titan's Legacy, combined two loved generes of games, stratagy, and civilization builders. Let's focus on the latter for now, civilization builders, more specifically, Settlers of Catan. In this game each player competes against one another in order to become the first player with 10 points. The way you gain points is to expand your civilization but building roads, collecting resources, and completing trades with either other players, or the bank.</p>

                <h2 id="otherworkCSSZenGardenHeader">Turn-based Combat</h2>
                <p>Now for the other mentioned genere, stratagy. Having to think about what consequences your current turn will have on the outcome of the game. For Titan's Legacy, this is a turnbased combat system against an AI. Instead of collecting resources as normal in catan, in Titan's Legacy, you must fight enemies in order to recieve resources. There is currently no punishment to the player for losing said battle, except for losing out on some resources. During the fight, the player has multiple options of what to do on their turn, attacking, bracing, attempting to dodge, and heal their character.</p>
