                <p>Abstract</p>
                <p>In the Web Application Development lab at the Center for Advanced Research and Technology (CART), teams were tasked with creating a website for a business within Jurassic Park, such as a local bakery or a merchandise store. To prepare for the project, in their English class, students read Michael Crichton’s 1990 novel, Jurassic Park and focused on the character, Ian Malcolm, who argues that science shows Jurassic Park as a business will fail due to the playout of chaos theory. Furthermore, learning life lessons through the chaos in Jurassic Park are explored as well as a discussion of how these lessons can be applied to one's everyday life.  These lessons include controlling what you can, as chaos theory represents unpredictability of complex systems, life falls under this category. This has many implications in our day to day life that can change how we perceive our everyday life as well as the choices we make and what we decide to do with our time.</p>

            <section id="jurrasicParkChaosEssay">
                <p>In Micheal Crichton’s Jurassic Park, Ian Macolm is a mathematician who works in collaboration with John Hammond in order to refine Jurassic Park. Jurassic Park iterates through multiple versions of dinosaurs throughout the book. As strange as Ian Malcolm is as a character, what he studies, chaos theory, is not strange in the book or in the average person’s life. Jurassic Park has many lessons that the reader can take away from it, however it is important for the reader to understand how these lessons can be applied to the real world.</p>
                <p>Chaos theory states that any minute change in a system's starting state can dramatically alter the outcome of that system. The chaos theory comes from the butterfly effect, a meteorologist, Edward Lorenz, was using a computer to make approximations of the upcoming weather, the computer he was using did not print all of the decimals that it used when calculating, given that predicting weather uses nonlinear equations, “multiplications during iterative processes amplify differences in an exponential manner” (Oestreicher, 2007). The key term ‘exponential’ is the clue of how the results of two systems with very small differences in starting state can lead to an exponentially massive difference in the end result. However, one common misconception about chaos theory is that it is randomness, which is not accurate to what chaos theory represents. Chaos theory represents unpredictability, not randomness, however in some cases it can be hard to tell the differences apart. The key difference between randomness and unpredictability is we are able to narrow down possible future results based on . One of the most important displays of chaos theory is the logistic map, popularized by Robert May in 1976. The equation for the logistic map was written by Pierre François Verhulst which is written mathematically as xn+1 = rxn(1-xn), “where n = 0, 1, ... describes the discrete time, the single dynamical variable, and 0≤r≤4 is a parameter. The dynamic of this function presents very different behaviors depending on the value of the parameter r: For 0 ≤ r ≤ 3, the system has a fixed point attractor that becomes unstable when r=3. Pour 3 < r < 3,57. The function has a periodic orbit as an attractor, of a period of 2n where n is an integer that tends towards infinity when r tends towards 3,57… When r=3,57..., the function then has a Feigenbaum fractal attractor. When over the value of r=4, the function goes out of the interval [0,1]” (Oestreicher, 2007). What this mathematical statement means is that as a complex system, such as the park in Jurassic Park, continues over a certain amount of time, it will tend towards chaos.</p>
                <p>“A Sound of Thunder” is a literary work written by Ray Bradbury (1952) that explores the idea of the butterfly effect. Who is speaking? “We don't want to change the Future. We don't belong here in the Past. The government doesn't like us here. We have to pay big graft to keep our franchise. A Time Machine is finicky business. Not knowing it, we might kill an important animal, a small bird, a roach, a flower even, thus destroying an important link in a growing species” (Bradbury, 1952). This quote relates back to the idea that a system with slightly different starting states and result is the system exponentially magnifying those differences.</p>
                <p>In Jurassic Park when Ian Malcolm is discussing chaos theory with Gennaro, Malcolm states, “But if I have a weather system that I start up with a certain temperature and a certain wind speed and a certain humidity—and if I then repeat it with almost the same temperature, wind, and humidity—the second system will not behave almost the same. It’ll wander off and rapidly will become very different from the first. Thunderstorms instead of sunshine. That’s nonlinear dynamics. They are sensitive to initial conditions: tiny differences become amplified” (Crichton, 1990, p. 74).</p>
                <p>The most obvious character that understands chaos theory is Ian Malcolm, after all in the book he has spent years studying chaos theory and its implications. Throughout the book Ian Malcolm attempts to explain chaos theory to multiple characters, however some were more willing to learn than others. The first character he talks to is Gennaro, he seems to understand the concept but does not understand why it works the way it is. Gennaro agrees with the basic implications of chaos theory such as the weather since we have no control over how the clouds form and such. However when it comes to the park, Gennaro seems confident that chaos theory will not apply since they have “control” over the animals. Many characters in the book fall under this category of their understanding of chaos theory, they understand the simple implications of the theory, however they don’t believe it has effect on large scale living systems.</p>
                <p>The first example of chaos theory given in the book comes from Ian Malcolm and Genaro’s conversation about why Ian Malcolm believes that the park will fail. “The shorthand is the ‘butterfly effect.’ A butterfly flaps its wings in Peking, and weather in New York is different.” (Crichton, 1990, p. 54). The reason this is a great example of chaos theory is due to the quote putting a complex mathematical phenomenon into everyday terms that a general population can understand. Everybody experiences weather, many know what a butterfly is, which is why this comparison makes the average person able to comprehend how a small change, such a butterfly flapping its wings, can have a large impact on the final outcome, the weather in New York. Another great example of chaos theory, and the common lack of knowledge about it, is John Hammond’s ignorance of his lack of control of the dinosaurs. Originally Hammond had planned to create and maintain twelve animals. However, soon the park surpassed that, with over two hundred dinosaurs, which Hammond and the park had seen through precautions in order to assure that there would be no issues. These precautions were designed for the small scale that Hammond had imagined, however it just happened to expand by a large amount, and these security protocols did not update alongside this. Eventually at the end of the book when the dinosaurs escaped, this was not due to poor planning by Hammond or any of the other park staff, yet this was a failure to follow along with the unpredictable changes to the park such as the increase in the number of dinosaurs.  Unpredictability should not be an end all be all of a plan, and this is the lesson readers should learn from this book. Ultimately, unpredictability is simply an opportunity for a person to persevere and adapt to the circumstances.</p>
                <p>Throughout the read of Jurassic Park many lessons can be learned, yet the hard part is understanding how to implement these valuable lessons into your everyday life. The ultimate goal is understanding when a bump in the road was something you could not foresee and working your way through it, or whether it was a tornado that you could not have predicted with any amount of information.</p>
