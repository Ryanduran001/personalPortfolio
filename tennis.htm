                <h2>CHS Boy's Tennis Team</h2>
                <p>I have been on the CHS Boy's Tennis Team for three years now, I was J.V Team Captain this year. Playing tennis is one of my favorite activites to do, not only have I met many of my friends through tennis, I also just enjoy playing the sport. During our season, we play each other school in our area twice, this means that I get to met and bond with the other teams as well.</p>

                <h2>Junior Tennis Circut</h2>
                <p>Junior Tennis Circut hosts bi-weekly tournaments, usually held on weekends at local high school campuses. The reason I particularly enjoy these tournaments is due to the competitive nature. Almost all participants are very close in skill, so every match is a close and exciting one. Although these tournaments are quite pricey to enter, the expirence is worth every penny!</p>
